# AlDente üçù
_MacOS menu bar tool to limit maximum charging percentage_

This is a modification of the original free software version of [AlDente](https://github.com/davidwernhart/AlDente/releases).
The following changes were made:
* Removed lots of unused code
* Moved sleep assertion code to the main app rather than the privileged helper
* Changed SMC key for charge limiting to CH0C since it changes both CH0B and CH0C
* Added discharging feature (using CH0J key)
* Both charging and discharging will only be initiated when the target level is 5% off
* When sleep is inhibited, clamshell sleep is also inhibited to prevent overcharging (thanks to code from [Amphetamine Enhancer](https://github.com/x74353/Amphetamine-Enhancer))
* Updated launch at login helper to be ARM native
* UI fixes
* Replaced icon with better one from @pedrocatalao
* Probably more that I forgot
